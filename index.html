		<h2>About Our Heroes</h2>
		<p>Eric is a an unexpected dinosaur who wears glasses, a rustic hat, and a purple necktie. He is a dinosaur who was created by Reza Farazmond. I first discovered Poorly Drawn Lines while on a trip to San Francisco. I happened to wander into a bookstore, where I noticed the first book since it was features as a new book by a local author. I picked it up and could not put it down, so I bought it on the spot. I've become a huge fan and followed the strip ever since.</p>
